  - path: pld_runtime/repair/repair_detector.py
    component_id: repair_detector
    kind: runtime_module
    area: repair
    status: experimental
    authority_level: 5
    purpose: >
      Detects drift conditions and issues PLD-compliant repair signals.
      Intended as an early runtime component for testing repair-based control flow.

    # Optional metadata fields (example usage):
    authority_scope: runtime implementation
    status_detail: "Implementation-specific detection logic; subject to refinement."

  - path: quickstart/hello_pld_runtime.py
    component_id: hello_pld_runtime
    kind: example
    area: onboarding
    status: stable
    authority_level: 2
    purpose: >
      Demonstrates the core runtime loop: Drift → Repair → Reentry → Continue → Outcome.
      Used for teaching and validating the mental model before deeper integration.


  - path: docs/07_pld_operational_metrics_cookbook.md
    component_id: metrics_cookbook
    kind: doc
    area: analytics
    status: candidate
    authority_level: 3
    purpose: >
      Defines operational metrics (PRDR, REI, VRL, MRBF, FR) and how they map to runtime behavior.
      Intended as a working reference for evaluation and field implementation teams.


  - path: analytics/sample_traces/
    component_id: trace_examples
    kind: metric
    area: validation
    status: draft
    authority_level: 1
    purpose: >
      Sample traces used for evaluating PLD behavior in experiments and controlled testing environments.
      Contents may evolve rapidly and are not guaranteed stable.
