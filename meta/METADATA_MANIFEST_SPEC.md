# **Metadata Manifest Specification — v0.9.1**

This specification defines the unified metadata format for the **Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD) Repository**.

## **🎯 Design Philosophy**

* **Centralized Discovery:** A root manifest.yaml acts as the primary inventory.  
* **Distributed Option:** Sub-directories (e.g., field/) may have their own manifests for external collaboration.  
* **Co-location:** Metadata stays with the code (via headers) or near the code (via manifest).

## **📍 File Locations**

1. **Root Manifest:** ./manifest.yaml (Required)  
2. **Sub Manifests:** path/to/folder/manifest.yaml (Optional, for isolated domains)

Path Resolution Rule:  
All paths in a manifest are relative to the directory containing that manifest.

## **🧩 Manifest Structure**

## **🧩 Manifest Structure & Granularity**

To balance governance with ease of contribution, components can be defined at two levels of granularity:

### **1. Explicit (File-Level)**
**Required for Authority Level 4 & 5 (Critical/Governed).**
Each critical file MUST be explicitly listed to ensure strict tracking.

- path: pld_runtime/core/controller.py
  component_id: core_controller
  ...

### **2. Implicit (Directory-Level)**
**Allowed for Authority Level 1, 2, & 3 (Docs/Examples/Metrics).**
A directory path covers all contained files. New non-critical files added to these directories do not require manifest updates.

- path: docs/metrics/visuals/   <-- Ends with slash
  component_id: metric_visuals_bundle
  kind: doc
  description: "All visualization assets for metrics."

## **📖 Controlled Vocabulary**

### **kind**

|

| Type | Description |  
| code | General source code |  
| runtime\_module | Core PLD logic (detectors, controllers) |  
| schema | Data definitions (JSON, YAML) |  
| config | Configuration files |  
| metric | Datasets, logs, or evaluation metrics |  
| doc | Documentation |  
| example | Demos and samples |

### **status**

| Status | Meaning |  
| experimental | Active development, unstable. |  
| draft | Work in progress (docs/specs). |  
| candidate | Review pending, feature complete. |  
| stable | Production-ready, breaking changes restricted. |

### **authority\_level (1–5)**

| Level | Scope | Governance |  
| 1 | Open / Local | Free to change. (e.g., local experiments, field notes) |  
| 2 | Collaborative | Shared resources. Change with lightweight review. |  
| 3 | Standard | Established patterns. Change requires rationale. |  
| 4 | Governed | Architecture/Spec. Change requires maintainer alignment. |  
| 5 | Critical | Core Runtime/Safety. Strict change control. |

## **🔗 Code Header Standard (L2 Validation)**

For Python (.py) files, metadata MUST appear in the **first 50 lines** using strict \# key: value syntax.

\# component\_id: repair\_detector  
\# status: experimental  
\# authority\_level: 5
