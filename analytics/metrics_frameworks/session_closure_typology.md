# Session Closure Typology Framework
Status: Draft / Research Use
Version: 2.0

---

## 1. Purpose

This framework documents how PLD sessions reach closure, and what closure style implies about system quality and user experience.

---

## 2. Closure Types Observed

| Closure Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Direct outcome | task completed without significant drift |
| Assisted outcome | outcome achieved with repair support |
| Stalled | unresolved loop or incomplete task |
| Failover terminal | system escalated to alternative strategy |
| Abandonment | user abandoned interaction |

---

## 3. Why Closure Matters

Closure connects runtime behavior with:

- Task satisfaction
- Agent trustworthiness
- Recovery efficiency
- Drift persistence

---

## 4. Analysis Lenses

- **Friction index**: number of alignment interventions required
- **Graceful degradation**: how failover impacts experience
- **Temporal patterns**: closure style changing across multi-session interaction

---

## 5. Research Questions

- Which closure types correlate with high recurrence drift?
- Can closure predict future task success probability?
- Is closure style stable per domain?
