# Continue–Repair Ratio Framework
Status: Draft / Research Use
Version: 2.0

---

## 1. Purpose

This framework explores interpretation of the **continue:repair ratio**, which tracks how often the agent proceeds vs. needing correction.

---

## 2. Why It Matters

The ratio is a **first-order stability indicator**:

- High continue frequency → stable alignment
- High repair frequency → alignment fragility or user misunderstanding

---

## 3. Observational Zones (Non-normative)

| Ratio Type | Interpretation |
|------------|----------------|
| 4:1 or higher | Highly aligned behavior |
| 2:1 | Acceptably stable |
| 1:1 | Repair dependency posture |
| <1:1 | Repair dominates execution |

---

## 4. Pattern Recognition

| Observation | Possible Meaning |
|------------|------------------|
| Spikes in repair rate | Model drift or domain boundary |
| Increasing stability over time | Learning / guideline internalization |
| Decline after new tools added | Feature complexity introduced cognitive overhead |

---

## 5. Research Questions

- Does ratio correlate with user satisfaction?
- Does ratio drift over long-running sessions?
- How does multi-turn task complexity affect alignment?
