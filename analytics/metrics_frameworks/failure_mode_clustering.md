# Failure Mode Clustering Framework
Status: Draft / Research Use
Version: 2.0

---

## 1. Purpose

This framework supports clustering PLD drift events to identify:

- recurrent failure signatures  
- systemic vs. contextual drift  
- remediation strategies

---

## 2. Types of Clusters Observed

| Cluster Type | Signal | Potential interpretation |
|--------------|--------|--------------------------|
| Semantic Drift | factual or meaning deviation | knowledge boundary or hallucination |
| Instruction Misalignment | ignores rules or user role | weak policy adherence |
| Tone / UX Breakage | style inconsistency or persona drift | uncontrolled expressive variation |
| Procedural Misstep | step skipped or misunderstood | runtime logic mismatch |

---

## 3. Clustering Inputs

- Event type
- Lifecycle phase
- Repair strategy applied
- Session structure
- Drift distance (semantic or symbolic)

---

## 4. Suggested Methods

- Hierarchical clustering
- Embedding projection with PLD structural boundaries
- Drift cause tagging matrix

---

## 5. Outcomes

Outputs typically generate:

- **taxonomy candidates**
- **policy-level interventions**
- **tooling or runtime adjustment insights**
