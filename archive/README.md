# PLD Legacy Archive

This directory contains **legacy artifacts** from earlier iterations of the PLD runtime
and specification.

- They are kept for historical and reference purposes.
- They **MUST NOT** be used as a source of truth for the current PLD model.
- Names and semantics may conflict with the v2.0+ runtime and docs.

For current documentation and runtime behavior, please refer to:

- `docs/PLD_Runtime_Standard_v2.0.md`
- `docs/PLD_Event_Semantic_Spec_v2.0.md`
- `pld_runtime/` (runtime implementation)
- `quickstart/` (minimal runnable examples)
