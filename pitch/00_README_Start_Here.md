# Start Here  
*A short guide before exploring this folder.*

---

## 👋 Who this folder is for

This content is intended for teams who are **evaluating whether PLD is worth adopting** — especially when internal alignment is needed across:

- AI product strategy  
- engineering leadership  
- applied ML teams  
- procurement or governance roles  
- executive stakeholders  

You do **not** need to know the technical details of PLD before reading this.

---

## 🎯 What this folder provides

This folder is a **communication kit**, not a technical manual.

It helps answer questions like:

- *“Why do promising multi-turn AI agents break at scale?”*  
- *“Is PLD a framework we must migrate to?”*  
- *“What is the business case for using PLD?”*  
- *“How do we explain this to leadership or cross-functional teams?”*

If the technical implementation becomes relevant later, the runtime and documentation live in other areas of the repository.

## 📚 Recommended Reading Order

To get value quickly, read in this order:

| Step | File | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| **1** | **01_PLD_in_30_seconds.md** | Understand the core idea in under a minute |
| **2** | **02_Why_MultiTurn_Agents_Fail.md** | Recognize the real problem PLD addresses |
| **3** | **03_PLD_Business_Value_Story.md** | Understand the strategic and operational value |
| **4 (optional)** | **04_Internal_Pitch_Kit.md** | Use ready-made language and templates to discuss PLD internally |

## 🖼 Visuals

If you prefer visuals first, the `visuals/` directory contains:

- a one-page conceptual diagram  
- before/after framing to support presentations

These visuals are optional, but helpful when sharing the idea across teams.

---

## 🧪 Status and Intent

This folder is currently in an **exploratory stage**.

The goal is to help teams evaluate PLD — not to declare a standard or prescribe adoption.

PLD continues to evolve, and **implementation feedback is welcome.**

---

## 🧵 If You Need a One-Sentence Summary

> **PLD helps multi-turn AI behave predictably over time — without replacing your existing architecture.**

---

If this material helps — or if something is unclear — please open an issue or discussion.  
This folder is expected to evolve based on real-world adoption and feedback.
