# PLD Starter Kit — Lightweight Collaboration Package

This folder provides a **minimal, practical set of templates** to help teams and partner organizations begin a PLD Proof-of-Concept (PoC) quickly and with minimal confusion.

The Starter Kit is intentionally simple:

* Easy to fill out in under 30 minutes
* Low cognitive load (Biz-friendly)
* No PLD technical expertise required
* Aligned with all normative PLD definitions (L1–L3) without exposing internal specs

This kit is ideal for:

* First-week onboarding with a new partner
* Running a small PLD evaluation
* Preparing sessions for the first joint review
* Ensuring both sides are aligned on scope and terminology

## 📁 Files in This Folder

### **1. PLD_scope_template.md**

[→ Open template](PLD_scope_template_example.md)

A fill-in-the-blank template used to define:

* Target system
* Scenarios under evaluation
* Tools / capabilities involved
* Time box
* Roles & responsibilities
* Success criteria (business-level)

Use this before kickoff to ensure both sides agree on **what is being evaluated**.

### **2. PLD_session_review_sheet.md**

[→ Open review sheet](PLD_session_review_sheet_example.md)

A lightweight table for reviewing **5–10 sessions** during the first joint evaluation.

Captures:

* Drift occurred? (Yes/No)
* Repair type (Soft / Hard / None)
* Reentry confirmed?
* Outcome
* Notes

Written in plain language so anyone can participate (PMs, Biz, QA, Analysts).

### **3. PLD_session_submission_template.md**

[→ Open submission template](PLD_session_submission_template_example.md)

A simple format for submitting sessions to Partner B:

* Short session summaries
* Masked transcripts
* PLD events (if available)
* Notes for review

Partners use this to provide consistent, anonymized traces during early evaluation.

## 🚀 Recommended First Week Flow

This is the **minimal workflow** to run a PLD PoC quickly.

### **Day 1 — Kickoff**

1. Copy `PLD_scope_template.md`
2. Fill it out (15–30 min)
3. Share with partner

### **Day 2–5 — Data Collection**

4. Gather 5–10 real user sessions
5. Mask sensitive content
6. Format using `PLD_session_submission_template.md`

### **Day 6–7 — Joint Review**

7. With your partner, review sessions using `PLD_session_review_sheet.md`
8. Identify:

   * Where drift occurred
   * Whether repair was appropriate
   * Whether reentry confirmed alignment
   * Final outcomes

This process gives both sides a clear view of **where stability succeeds or breaks**.

## 🧭 Why This Starter Kit Works

This kit is designed to:

* Lower onboarding friction
* Remove ambiguity in early collaboration
* Provide just enough structure to make PLD useful immediately
* Keep all evaluations aligned with the PLD Loop (Drift → Repair → Reentry → Outcome)

It is **not**:

* A full evaluation framework
* A replacement for detailed PLD specifications (L1–L3)
* A heavy governance process

Instead, it is the fastest way to get two teams aligned.

## 📌 Tips for Successful Use

* Keep scope narrow in the beginning (1–3 scenarios)
* Focus on major drift patterns, not perfect metrics
* Review sessions synchronously if possible
* Use this folder as the living “source of truth” during PoC

If additional templates or support tools are needed (dashboards, worksheets, diagrams), they can be added here incrementally as real-world usage grows.
