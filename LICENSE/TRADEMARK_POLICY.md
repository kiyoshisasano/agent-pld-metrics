**Trademarks Notice:**  
"PLD", "Phase Loop Dynamics", and related marks are claimed as common law trademarks of Kiyoshi Sasano.  
Use of the marks is welcomed when referring to the methodology, research, or implementations.  
Commercial or branding use is governed by this policy.  
All other trademarks are the property of their respective owners.  

---

This document defines how names and marks related to **Phase Loop Dynamics (PLD)** 
may be used.

## Goals

- Enable open usage, research, and reference to PLD methodology
- Prevent misleading claims of affiliation, certification, or endorsement
- Protect the framework's identity and meaning as it evolves

---

## Protected Marks

The following names and marks are claimed by Kiyoshi Sasano:

- **PLD** (when used in the context of runtime agent governance)
- **Phase Loop Dynamics**
- Visual marks and logos included in this repository

**Trademark Status:** These are currently **unregistered common law trademarks**. 
Registration may be pursued as the project matures. The absence of ® does not 
diminish the trademark claims or this policy.

**Note on Metrics:** The PRDR, REI, and VRL metrics are protected under copyright (CC BY 4.0) rather than trademark law.
You may reference and use these metrics with proper attribution per the license, including in commercial systems.

---

## Permitted Uses (No Permission Required)

You may freely use these marks when **referring to the framework**, including:

✅ Academic papers, citations, and research  
✅ Software compatibility statements ("works with PLD")  
✅ Tutorials, demos, or educational implementations  
✅ Internal company tooling or dashboards  
✅ Non-commercial user education and community discussion  

### Example Permitted Phrasings

> *"This system implements the PLD runtime loop."*  
> *"Based on Phase Loop Dynamics methodology by Kiyoshi Sasano."*  
> *"Compatible with PLD-style drift → repair → reentry workflows."*  
> *"Uses PRDR metrics for stability evaluation."*

---

## Restricted Uses (Permission Required)

You must request written approval before using the marks in ways that suggest:

⚠️ Official partnership, certification, or endorsement  
⚠️ That your implementation is the "official" or "canonical" PLD runtime  
⚠️ Commercial products where "PLD" is central to the brand identity  

### Examples Requiring Permission

🚫 *"Certified PLD Runtime"* (implies official certification)  
🚫 *"Official PLD Agent Platform"* (suggests endorsement)  
🚫 *"PLD Enterprise Edition"* (implies official commercial offering)  
🚫 Company names, conference titles, or SaaS products with only "PLD" in the name

## Domains, Packages, and Product Names

### Package Names (PyPI, NPM, etc.)

You may not register packages that suggest official status:

❌ `pld-official`, `phase-loop-dynamics-core`  
❌ `pld-runtime` (without explicit permission)  

**Acceptable alternatives:**

✔ `pld-experiments`, `my-pld-adapter`  
✔ `company-name-pld`, `framework-pld-bridge`  
✔ `rasa-pld-repair`, `langgraph-pld-integration`  

### Domain Names

Domains containing only "PLD" or "Phase Loop Dynamics" as primary branding 
require permission:

❌ `pld-runtime.com`, `phaseloopdynamics.ai` (without permission)  

**Acceptable:**

✔ `company.com/pld-integration`  
✔ `myproject-with-pld.dev`

## Visual Identity & Logos

### License vs Trademark

The SVG diagrams and visual materials are licensed under **CC BY 4.0** 
for their *content* — you may use, adapt, and share them with attribution.

However, *trademark law* separately governs using these visuals as *branding* 
or in ways suggesting official affiliation.

**You may:**

✅ Include diagrams in presentations, papers, tutorials (CC BY 4.0)  
✅ Adapt or remix visuals with attribution maintained  
✅ Use in documentation or educational materials  

**You may NOT:**

❌ Remove or obscure the attribution required under the CC BY 4.0 license  
❌ Modify visuals in a way that implies official status, endorsement, or certification  
❌ Use visuals as branding for a commercial product named "PLD" or positioned as the official implementation  
 

**Clarification:** The license governs *usage rights*; trademark law governs 
*brand identity*. Both must be respected.

---

## Enforcement

We address trademark concerns through a **graduated, collaborative approach**:

1. **Friendly contact** — Initial outreach to discuss and understand usage
2. **Collaborative resolution** — Working together to clarify appropriate use
3. **Formal measures** — Reserved for deliberate fraud, impersonation, or 
   commercial deception

**Our goal is clarity and fairness, not conflict.** Most trademark questions 
can be resolved through good-faith discussion.

We encourage you to contact us *before* launching something if you're unsure 
whether it requires permission.

## Evolution of This Policy

This policy may be updated as:

- The framework gains broader adoption
- Community governance structures mature
- Certification or compliance programs emerge

Significant revisions will be versioned and dated at the top of this document.
